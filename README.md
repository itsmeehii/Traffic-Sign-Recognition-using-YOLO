Traffic Sign Recognition using YOLOv8
Developed a traffic sign recognition system using the YOLOv8 framework from Ultralytics.
Trained the model on labeled traffic sign datasets, optimized performance, and utilized the best.pt weights for real-time prediction.
Designed a user-friendly frontend, integrated it with a backend API for inference, and established smooth connectivity between the UI and the trained model to enable accurate and fast traffic sign detection.
